= dpkg-tools: less-painful OS package building

dpkg-tools is a set of tools which aim to dramatically simplify the process of creating and building OS packages. We're targetting .debs, and creating one can be as simple as creating and maintaining a YAML configuration file. For Rubygems, the process is even easier - a single command makes a gem ready to be built into a .deb

== Warning: Alpha software

Hey, this is alpha stuff. There's plenty cruft and rough edges, the RDoc's pretty bad and there's a general lack of good documentation and examples. I'm working on it. You're more than welcome to join in. 

== How to get it

  gem install dpkg-tools
  
Or, the gem can be downloaded from http://rubyforge.org/projects/dpkg-tools/.

The source is available from Github: http://github.com/fidothe/dpkg-tools/, and bugs, requests and other queries can be filed at http://dpkg-tools.lighthouseapp.com/. You can clone the public Git repo with:

  git clone git://github.com/fidothe/dpkg-tools.git
