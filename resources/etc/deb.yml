# The name MUST follow the conventions of Debian package naming,
# since we use the name to make a Debian package...
# Basically, lowercase letters, numbers and hyphend are fine
# everything else is verboten:
# http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Package
name: "configuration-package"
# Version is used for creating the package too. Version strings 
# of the format X.Y.Z are used: 1.0, 1.0.1, etc. FYI, 1.1.5 is a 
# LOWER version number than 1.10 - 1.10 is equivalent to 1.10.0
version: "1.0"
